## üì¢ Use Lowcoder in 3 steps
1. Connect to any data sources or APIs.
2. Build UI with 50+ components.
3. Share with colleagues and customers.

## üí° Why Lowcoder
It's cumbersome to create a single app. You had to design user interfaces, write code in multiple languages and frameworks, and understand how all of that code works together.

Low-code/No-code platforms are fast to get started with but quickly become unmaintainable and inflexible. This creates more problems than it solves.

NewGen Lowcode Platforms like Retool and others are great for their simplicity and flexibility - like Lowcoder too, but they can also be limited in different ways, especially when it comes to "external" applications for everyone.

Lowcoder wants to take a step forward. More specifically, Lowcoder is:
- An all-in-one IDE to create internal or customer-facing (external) apps.
- A place to create, build and share building blocks of web applications.
- The tool and community to support your business, and lower the cost and time to develop interactive applications.
- The only platform to embed Lowcode Apps natively in Websites (no iFrame!)
- The only platform where you can build your own Meeting Tool - like Teams, Zoom or Google Meets, - just in the Lowcode way.

## ü™Ñ Features
- **Visual UI builder** with 50+ built-in components. Save 90% of time to build apps.
- **Modules** for reusable (!) component sets in the UI builder.

- **Video Meeting Components** to create your own individual Web-Meeting tool.
- **Query Library** for reusable data queries of your data sources.
- **Custom components** to develop own components and use them in the UI builder.
- **Native Data connections** to PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, REST API, SMTP, etc.
- **Stream Data connections** to Websockets for realtime data updates & collaboration
- **JavaScript supported everywhere** to transform data, control components, etc.
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** for granular permission management.
- **Auto-saved and restorable history** for release and version control.
- **App Themes and Theme Editor** to precisely align with your company's brand guidelines.
